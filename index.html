        <h2>Quick Icon test of 250px and 500px</h2>
        <p>So I wanted to see what would happen if I created 2 icons of different sizes.  I kind of expected that they may become the same size as all it cares about is the ratio.  However as is evident here,  the size of the icon alters based on the measurements of the svg you use to create your font...So the clue for myself and for other here is:  <span class="inline">Always make sure ALL of your icons are the same size!!!</span></p>
